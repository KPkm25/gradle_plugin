# Project Setup Automation with Gradle Plugin

This project provides a custom **Gradle plugin** that automates the following tasks for your Gradle-based projects:

- **Versioning**: Automatically increments the patch version of the project.
- **Dependency Validation**: Checks if required dependencies are included in the project.
- **Project Setup**: Automates the creation of basic project structure (directories, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, etc.).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the Gradle plugin and automate project setup, versioning, and dependency checks in your own 
Gradle project.

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or higher** installed. - **Gradle 8.5** or higher installed. - A **Gradle-based project**.

If you don't have Gradle installed, you can follow the instructions here: [Gradle

2. **Run setupProject Task:** 
This task automates the creation of basic project structure. It will create the directories if they don't exist. 
```
